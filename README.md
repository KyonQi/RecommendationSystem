# Recommendation System
For NCSU GEAR 2022
# Introduction
It's the repository of GEAR2022 Program in NCSU, realizing a classic recommendation system, i.e., YouTubeDNN.

And, based on YouTubeDNN, we add attention mechanism to the original model so as to improve the performance of it.

To evaluate our model, we use **Accuracy** and **Recall** as the evaluating metrics.

Also, we give an visual example to show the outperformance of our revised model in our poster.

Source codes are shared in the form of Colab notebook, cus You can train the model for free.

# Poster
We make a poster to present our work.

The complete PDF poster is also in this repository.

# End
~~The Colab codes would be sorted later if available.~~

Now I have sorted out three python files named **main.py**, **model.py**, **utils.py**.

All you need to do is replace some file directions with your own ones.

But it's still recommended to run the experiment codes in Colab ~ lol.

If you have any problems, don't hesitate to raise up **Issues** here!
